# Security Boundaries

The agent operates with significant power (file system, shell, web). The following guards must not be bypassed when modifying related code.

## Workspace Restriction

Filesystem tools (`read_file`, `write_file`, `edit_file`, `list_dir`, `apply_patch`) resolve paths through the workspace path resolver (`agent/tools/filesystem.py` / `agent/tools/path_utils.py`), which enforces that the resolved path must lie under the active workspace when workspace restriction is enabled. The media upload directory is always an internal extra read root while restricted.

Additional filesystem roots must be capability-specific. `extra_allowed_dirs` is a legacy read-only alias. Use `extra_read_allowed_dirs` for read-only roots and `extra_write_allowed_dirs` only when a write-capable tool is intentionally allowed to modify an extra root.

Shell execution (`ExecTool`, `agent/tools/shell.py`) also respects `restrict_to_workspace` as an application-level guard: if enabled and `working_dir` is outside the workspace, the command is rejected before execution, and command text is checked for obvious workspace escapes. This is not process-level isolation; use an exec sandbox backend for that.

**Rule**: Any new path-handling logic must go through the workspace path resolver or perform an equivalent containment check with explicit read/write capability semantics.

## SSRF Protection

All outbound HTTP requests from agent tools must pass through `validate_url_target` (`security/network.py`). By default it blocks RFC1918 private addresses, link-local ranges, and cloud metadata endpoints (including `169.254.169.254`).

The only escape hatch is `configure_ssrf_whitelist(cidrs)`, which reads from `config.tools.ssrf_whitelist` at load time.

**Rule**: Do not add direct `httpx.get` / `requests.get` calls in tools. Route through the existing web fetch utilities or replicate the `validate_url_target` check.

## Shell Sandbox

`tools/sandbox.py` provides optional command wrapping. The only backend currently shipped is `bwrap` (bubblewrap), intended for containerized deployments. On Windows and bare-metal Linux without `bwrap`, commands run in the native shell with workspace restriction as an application-level guard only.

**Rule**: If adding a new sandbox backend, implement `_wrap_<name>(command, workspace, cwd) -> str` and register it in `_BACKENDS`.
